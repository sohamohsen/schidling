1. Initialize Git in Your Project Folder
For terminal (Linux/macOS/Windows Command Prompt):
Open the terminal and navigate to your project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project
Initialize a Git repository in the folder:

2. Add All Files to Git

Commit the files you added with an appropriate commit message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"
4. Create a Repository on GitHub
Navigate to GitHub.
Click on the + icon in the upper right corner and select New repository.
Name your repository (e.g., your-project-name) and choose whether it's public or private.
Do not initialize the repository with a README (since you already have files in your project folder).
Click Create repository.

Add the remote to your local repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
6. Push Your Code to GitHub
